tomorrow-night.vim
==================

A tomorrow night theme created for use with NeoBundle in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/squarefrog/dotfiles).

## Tomorrow Theme

The [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) is a beautiful precursor to [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) created by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/).

## The issue

The problem with [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) at the time of writing is that it doesn't handle diffs very well.

I created a [pull request](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/pull/258) to fix those issues, but I also wanted a lightweight version which worked with [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) which is my preferred Vim plugin manager.

## License

This project is based on [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) which remains the copyright of [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/). The original project was released under the MIT license, and this one follows suit.

## Contributing

In the unlikely event you want to contribute to this colour scheme, I recommend you implement the changes in the [original project](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).
